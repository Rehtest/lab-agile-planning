# lab-agile-planning
This repository contains the lab for agile planning as a part of the course 'Agile and Scrum Fundamentals' by IBM.

The lab consisted of connecting Zenhub to Github, details are here: 

Exercise 1 : Create a free GitHub account
In this exercise, you will create a free GitHub account, if you don't already have one. ZenHub requires GitHub so this first step is a prerequisite to getting a ZenHub account.

Go to GitHub.com and sign up for a free GitHub account.

Enter your email address and press the Sign up for GitHub button. If you have an account, press the Sign in button and login.

You should now have a new repository called lab-agile-planning that we will use with ZenHub. It should look similar to the screenshot below:

Exercise 3 : Create free ZenHub account
In this exercise, you will create a free ZenHub account to use with GitHub. ZenHub is an application that integrates with GitHub. In order to use it, you must sign up for a free account.

Go to www.zenhub.com and press the Try for free button. Even though it says “Start your free 14-day trial with ZenHub“ you can continue to use ZenHub for free on open source projects.

Exercise 4 : (Optional) Browser extension for Chrome or Firefox
In this optional exercise, you will download a browser extension for ZenHub.

If you use Chrome or Firefox, you can download a browser extension for ZenHub that will add a ZenHub tab while you are using GitHub so that you don’t have to go to zenhub.com to view your kanban board.

Download a browser extension for ZenHub here: www.zenhub.com/extension. Once installed, it will add a ZenHub tab while you are using GitHub. This is purely a convenience. The capabilities of both the browser extension and the web zenhub.com site are the same.
Summary
Congratulations! You are now set up with a ZenHub account and GitHub account so that you can work through the rest of the labs.
